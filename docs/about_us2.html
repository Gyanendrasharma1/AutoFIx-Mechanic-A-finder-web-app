            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <p>At <strong>AutoFix</strong>, our journey began with a simple yet powerful idea: to simplify the often frustrating process of finding and booking a mechanic. The automotive industry has traditionally been marked by a lack of transparency, accessibility, and trust, making it difficult for vehicle owners to connect with reliable service providers. We recognized this gap and set out to create a solution that would not only address these issues but also enhance the overall experience for users.</p>
